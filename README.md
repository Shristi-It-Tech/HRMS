A sophisticated and lightweight HRMS frontend built with React and Vite, designed for modern workforce management. This application showcases advanced frontend engineering with a multi-layer real-time authentication system, integrating client-side Computer Vision (CV) via MediaPipe/TensorFlow for mandatory biometric selfie attendance and precise geolocation radius checks for CLOCK IN/OUT operations.

## Key Features

-   **Biometric Selfie Attendance**: Mandates face detection using client-side ML models (MediaPipe/TensorFlow) to ensure the right person is clocking in/out.
-   **Geolocation Radius Check**: Verifies that the user is within a predefined office radius before allowing attendance submission, preventing remote check-ins.
-   **Role-Based UI (RBAC)**: Dynamically renders components and features based on user roles (Employee, Supervisor, Manager, Owner), providing tailored experiences.
-   **Permit Management**: A streamlined system for employees to submit and for supervisors/managers to approve leave and permit requests.
-   **Reporting Dashboard**: (For Managers/Owners) View and generate reports on payroll and employee performance.
-   **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with React for component-based UI and Vite for lightning-fast development and optimized builds.
-   **Modular Architecture**: A clean, scalable codebase organized around custom hooks (`useCamera`, `useAuth`, `useFaceDetection`) and reusable components.
-   **Edge ML Deployment**: Demonstrates the capability of running machine learning models directly in the user's browser for real-time inference.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Running as Two Services (frontend + backend)

This repo now treats the UI and API as two separate deployable apps.

- **Frontend (Vite React app)**
  - Env: copy `.env.frontend.example` to `.env` and set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to your API URL.
  - Dev: `pnpm run dev:frontend`
  - Build: `pnpm run build:frontend` (outputs to `dist/`)
  - Preview (production-like): `pnpm run start:frontend`
  - Docker: `docker build -f Dockerfile.frontend -t hrms-frontend .`

- **Backend (Express + MongoDB API)**
  - Env: copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and set `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, etc.
  - Dev: `pnpm run dev:backend`
  - Start (prod): `pnpm run start:backend`
  - Docker: `docker build -f backend/Dockerfile -t hrms-backend backend`

When deploying, point your frontend hosting provider (e.g., Vercel/Netlify) at the repo root and use `pnpm run build:frontend` as the build command. Deploy the backend separately (e.g., Render/Railway/Docker host) using `backend/Dockerfile`, expose port `4000`, and set the same API URL in the frontend env.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v16 or higher) and `npm` (or `yarn`/`pnpm`) installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/hrms-frontend.git
    cd hrms-frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

Start the Vite development server with hot module replacement.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL shown in your terminal).

### Building for Production

Create an optimized production build in the `dist` folder.

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build locally with:

```bash
npm run preview
```
```login
user      : employee, manager, owner, supervisor
password  : password
```

## Project Structure & Architecture

The project follows a modular and scalable architecture. State management is handled primarily by custom hooks, and UI is split into role-specific components.

## Core Concepts

### Biometric Authentication Flow

1.  **Trigger**: User (e.g., Employee) clicks "CLOCK IN".
2.  **Modal Activation**: `CameraModal` component is rendered.
3.  **Camera Access**: The `useCamera` hook requests camera access and starts the video stream.
4.  **Face Detection**: The stream is fed into the `useFaceDetection` hook, which uses a pre-loaded MediaPipe/TensorFlow model to continuously analyze the video frames.
5.  **Validation**: If a face is detected with sufficient confidence, the "Capture" button is enabled.
6.  **Capture & Proceed**: The user captures the selfie. The image and attendance data are then sent for geolocation verification.

### Geolocation Verification

1.  **Request Location**: After a successful selfie, the application uses the browser's `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentAPI()` to get the user's current latitude and longitude.
2.  **Radius Check**: These coordinates are compared against a predefined central office location and a maximum allowed radius (in meters).
3.  **Success/Failure**: If the user is within the radius, the attendance is marked as "Valid". Otherwise, an error is shown.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The `useAuth` hook is the central point for managing user state. It typically stores user information, including their `role`.

-   **Conditional Rendering**: Components like `App.jsx` or layout components use the role from `useAuth` to conditionally render different pages or components.
    -   `role === 'employee'` -> Renders `EmployeeAttendance`.
    -   `role === 'supervisor'` -> Renders `SupervisorAttendance` and permit approval lists.
-   **API/Data Security**: While the UI hides features, the `DataService` should also send the user's role/token with API requests to ensure backend security.

## For Developers

-   **Data Persistence**: For demo purposes, user data and attendance records are stored in `localStorage`. For a production environment, you **must** replace the functions in `src/services/DataService.js` with actual HTTP requests (e.g., using `axios` or `fetch`) to your backend API.
-   **ML Model Loading**: The face detection model is loaded on the client-side. Be mindful of the model's file size as it can impact the initial application load time. Consider using a lighter model or implementing a loading state.
-   **Permission Flow**: The logic for submitting and approving permits is primarily located within `EmployeeAttendance.jsx` and `SupervisorAttendance.jsx`. Examine these components to understand the state flow for creating and updating permit status.
-   **Custom Hooks**: The project heavily relies on custom hooks to encapsulate complex logic.
    -   `useAuth`: Manages login state, user data, and role.
    -   `useCamera`: Provides a clean API (`start`, `stop`, `stream`) for camera components.
    -   `useFaceDetection`: Abstracts away the complexity of the ML model, returning simple booleans like `isFaceDetected`.
